    <abstract>
 <t>
This document discusses an deployment scenario called "an IPv6-Mostly network", when IPv6-only and IPv4-enabled endpoints coexist on the same network (network segment, VLAN, SSID etc).

      <name>Introduction</name>
<t>
While most network operators initially deploy IPv6 alongside their existing IPv4 infrastructure, pure IPv6-only networks remain uncommon outside of the mobile carrier space. This dual-stack approach is seen as a necessary transition phase, allowing operators to gain experience with IPv6 while minimizing disruption.
</t>

<t>
However, dual-stack networks don't address the core problem driving IPv6 adoption: IPv4 address exhaustion. They still require the same amount of IPv4 resources as IPv4-only networks.  Even worse, this dual-stack approach often becomes a long-term crutch. Many applications still rely on IPv4, creating a chicken-and-egg problem: IPv6-only networks seem impractical with so many incompatible applications, yet applications continue to rely on IPv4 because IPv6-only networks are rare.
</t>

<t>
The less control a network operator has over devices and applications, the more difficult it is to break IPv4 dependencies and move to IPv6-only. This is particularly challenging in enterprise networks with legacy IPv4-dependent applications and public WiFi networks where operators cannot guarantee device compatibility.
</t>

<t>
To enable a gradual migration, operators need to identify which devices can function in IPv6-only mode and which cannot. Creating separate network segments for each type introduces complexity and scalability issues â€“ a major hurdle to IPv6-only adoption.
</t>

<t>
A more desirable approach is to deploy so-called "IPv6-mostly" network that provides IPv4 on demand. This allows IPv6-capable devices to remain IPv6-only while seamlessly supplying IPv4 to those that require it.
</t>

<t>
This document explores the requirements, recommendations, and challenges associated with deploying IPv6-mostly networks in enterprise and public WiFi environments. While the principles discussed may be applicable to other network types, this document's focus remains on these specific use cases.

<name>Signalling NAT64 Prefix to Hosts</name>
<t>
Hosts running 464XLAT need to discover the PREF64 (the IPv6 prefix used by NAT64).
The network administrator SHOULD configure the first-hop routers to include PREF64 information in Router Advertisements as per (<xref target="RFC8781"/>) even if the network provides DNS64 (so hosts can use DNS64-based prefix discovery, <xref target="RFC7050"/>).
This is required as hosts or individual applications might have custom DNS configuration (or even run a local DNS server) and ignore DNS64 information provided by the network, so they can not use <xref target="RFC7050"/> method to detect PREF64.
In the absense of PREF64 information in Router Advertisements such systems would not be able to run clat, which would cause connectivity issues for all IPv4-only applications running on the affected device. 
As such device wouldn't be able to use the network-provided DNS64, access to IPv4-only destination would be impacted as well.
At the time of writing all major OSes supporting DHCPv4 option 108 and enabling clat automatically also support <xref target="RFC8781"/>.
Therefore providing PREF64 information in RAs can reliably mitigate the impact of custom DNS configuration on those systems.
</t>
<t>
Receiving PREF64 information in RAs also speeds up the clat start up time, so an IPv4 address and default route become available for applications much faster.

<name>Typical Issues</name>
<t>
This section discusses some typical issues which might be observed in IPv6-mostly networks.
Without safety net of IPv4 to fallback if IPv6 is broken, all potential network issues and IPv6 bugs become much more visible and impactful.
However implememtation bugs are mostly out of scope of this document, as such bugs would vary from network to network, depending on equipment and software used.
Instead this section focuses on issues caused by configuration, topology or design choices.
It should be noted that most of those issues usually pre-exist in dual-stack networks, but, as devices can fall back to IPv6, those problems are often remain unnoticed until IPv4 is taken away. 
The network administrators are advised to audit and monitor for the scenarios described below prior to migrate an existing network to IPv6-mostly mode.

If devices can move between network segments (VLANs) (e.g. if 802.1x with RADIUS-based VLAN assignment is used), it is recommended to reduce min and max Router Advertisement intervals to ensure that unsolicited RAs are sent as often as possible.
It is also recommended to decrease PIO lifetimes
